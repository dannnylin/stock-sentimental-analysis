<h1>Stock Sentiment Analysis</h1>
<br>
<p>This mini-project is for me to learn to use sentiment analysis with IBM Watson Tone Analyzer to see how positive/negative people feel towards a stock. Currently, this onl;y scrapes people's views through their tweets on Twitter, but I plan on using Selenium to web scrape news headlines regarding the desired stock and performing sentiment analysis on that as well.
